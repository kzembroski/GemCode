The BitCalculator class has three functions that correspond to each of the tasks of the coding challenge.

-- hexToBase64() takes in a hex encoded string and encodes it in base64.

-- fixedXOR() takes in two hex encoded strings and outputs the xor value between the two.

-- decode() takes a hex encoded string and decodes the string to its string representation.
