The BitCalculator class has three functions that correspond to each of the tasks of the coding challenge.

-- hexToBase64() takes in a hex encoded string and encodes it in base64.

-- fixedXOR() takes in two hex encoded strings and outputs the xor value between the two.

-- decode() takes a hex encoded string and decodes the string to its string representation.

---------------------------------
Running the Code

Running the code will run just the main() method with a few examples/tests using the functions and printing the results
to the terminal.

From command line...

```
$ cd src
$ javac BitCalculator.java
$ java BitCalculator
```
